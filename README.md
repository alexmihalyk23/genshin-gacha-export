# Genshin Wish Exporter

Electron + Vite + Vue3 + Tailwindcss

## Note

This is not made by me, original author: [biuuu](https://github.com/biuuu)

I only translated the text strings and made some visual adjustments on the exported excel (the default cell width is too small as Chinese characters are much shorter).

There are codes that auto update this tool in the background by the original author but I've removed it to avoid any security concerns. I will make annoucements if there is any updates related to this tool on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/takagg)

Do not use this tool if you are worried of getting banned even though this tool will not in any way modify the game files. It will only read necessary information available in the game files (and subsequently make wish history via API).

Have a nice day.
